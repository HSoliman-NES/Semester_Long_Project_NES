# Semester_Long_Project_NES
This is my semester long project from Northeast State Community College. 

## What This Project Will Do?
This program will be used to create an anonymous chat app for classroom usage, namely for students to communicate and ask questions within ceratin classes. 

## How it Will Achieve its Goal
I will achieve this goal by learning and implementing skills learned from the Computer Science II class, namely the use of APIs, inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of GUIs. 

## Expected Outcomes
I expect this program to let users first assign themselves to a chat color for their text, then enter a chatroom of their desired class, and then let the user message other users inside of the chatroom. 

## API List 
TBD
